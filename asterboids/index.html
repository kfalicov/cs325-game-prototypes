<h2>Aster-boids</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?<br>
Never before has there been an asteroids game where the objective is to smash your ships into the asteroids! Featuring a complete absence of weaponry, this game boasts a defensive and avoidance-focused approach to the arcade classic.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
I used boid interactions to make the fleet movement more interesting. The boids try to remain separate from each other while tracking the mothership. This makes it easier to assess the size of the fleet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
I learned a lot about boids and their interactions.<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
I was running into many problems with phaser's collision handling. My goal was to make the boids group and the asteroids group collide and destroy them, and spawn new boids if the smallest asteroids were destroyed. However, the program's collision wasn't accurately testing for dead asteroids and boids, so there was a weird infinite loop when asteroids were destroyed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>I reused a lot of the code from my <a href="buffalo-wings">Buffalo Wings</a> game, specifically the spawning mechanism, timed difficulty increases, and the looping through world edges mechanic. My original design was to have the player control the entire flock by gradually influencing the densest cluster of them, but I ran out of time to implement that and ended up just coding a "leader" for the sprites to follow. I think it makes the game more difficult as well.</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
A fleet of ships has to defend their mothership with their lives as they navigate a dangerous asteroid field.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.<br>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
Keyboard input, a lot of randomness, overhead shooter(?) genre, Collector/Achiever play style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
The mechanic this prototype is evaluating is boid interactions and the concept of controlling a group of boids.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
I want players to have fun with this new take on a classic.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
The inputs a player can make are the left and right arrow keys to rotate, and the up arrow to thrust.
The ship travels with lots of acceleration and slippery physics, making it feel more like it's in space.
A fleet of smaller ships always attempts to return to the mothership, and these can be used to destroy asteroids by directing them at the obstacles. Originally the gameplay was going to involve the player controlling one of the boids in the flock and influencing their movement that way.  The expected result of the low friction and acceleration is that navigation is tricky and imprecise, and it requires careful use of the fleet to form a shield.
Boids spawn every time asteroids spawn, and a few also spawn when the smallest asteroids are destroyed. The game spawns boids at a loss, you will never have enough boids to destroy all asteroids on screen after the beginning.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
If the mothership flies around the borders of the game, the boids will attempt to follow it. With enough momentum you can create a "wall" of boids traveling from one side of the screen to the other.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
Navigating an asteroid field is tricky. Good thing you've got a swarm of tough small ships! They can severely damage asteroids by colliding into them, and if they collide with the smallest ones you even get enough resources to build more!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
Arcade nostalgics who are looking for a challenge
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br>
About 5 minutes.
