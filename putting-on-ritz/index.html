<h2>Putting on the Ritz (Early Access)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is a stealth-based golfing game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game combines physics-based projectile aiming with stealth platforming.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I had to learn how to create many different input event handlers, and I also learned that time estimation for a game is quite difficult.
The hardest part was the physics trajectory system, getting it to display an accurate predictive trajectory took quite a bit of head-scratching.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I hastily made all of my prototype assets from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul><li>I used the base framework for the platformer found at <a href="https://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/3">https://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/3</a>, and added a physics system with accelerations and drag based on trial and error and the documentation found online.  </li>
<li>Additional key bindings were used with help from <a href="https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.1/Phaser.KeyCode.html">https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.1/Phaser.KeyCode.html</a>. </li>
<li>The most helpful tutorial was the physics sling tutorial at <a href="http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/09/08/html5-physics-sling-with-predictive-trajectory-like-trick-shot-ios-game-using-phaser-box2d/">http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/09/08/html5-physics-sling-with-predictive-trajectory-like-trick-shot-ios-game-using-phaser-box2d/</a>, which had to be rewritten so I could use it with arcade physics.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A golfer tries to break into the Ritz hotel by taking out the guards on the roof and sneaking in.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Golfer
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is arrow keys and mouse, genre is platformer, and play style is stealth.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Angular launch physics of objects
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to get accustomed to launching the balls reliably so that I can phase out the predictive trajectory and they will feel like they are learning the physics of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left and right with the w and d keys, jump with spacebar, crouch with ctrl, and sprint by holding shift while moving.  Clicking and dragging on the screen places a golf ball at the player's feet and begins the golf swing, the trajectory is determined by how far back the mouse is dragged.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Learning how to launch the ball with different forces, and crouching to move silently will help make the player move undetected.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The Golfer is an average man with an affinity for golf.  He gets turned down by the Ritz hotel when trying to get a room, but determined to gain access to the fancy hotel, he decides to sneak in the roof.  As a golfer his skill set involves hitting random objects with his golf club, with the objective of distracting or knocking out the guards on the roof.
The tension in the game is manifested by the stealth aspect.  The player wants not to be seen, and the objective is to sneak around, so the player feels a sense of dread when overwhelmed with many guards and few options.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target demographic is older kids, from middle to high school.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game would ideally have enough levels to last for many hours of play, with each level taking 3-5 minutes.
</li>
