<h2>Yarr! (remake)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?<br>
Yarr! Idle has a complex ship-building mechanic in which you can expand your arsenal and your ship's size!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
I had to design a way that the squares of the ship would detect empty spaces around them (with a total size limit in mind) and that you could build new boxes in these spaces. The structure used is a dual-axis "quadruply-linked list" that I implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
I learned how to create and represent complex data structures in Javascript.<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
The most difficult part was getting the room placement just right. I ran into many bugs just in an attempt to get rooms to sit correctly and be placed and removed correctly. I also didn't want the placement tiles to be overlapping, since when you're placing something and it borders two other squares, it still only takes up one square itself, and having stacked sprites with alpha looked ugly anyway. I fixed it by doing a once-over loop of the areas and checking for doubles.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Ship Rooms: self made</li>
<li>Game Background: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean">Google Images, Wikipedia</a></li>
<li>Menu Background: <a href="http://moon-guard.wikia.com/wiki/Pirate_King%27s_War">here</a></li>
<li>Ship parts: self-made (I'll do a graphical update later, I promise)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>Yarr! <a href="../yarr">here</a></li>
<li>The concept of an almost-idle ship building game was one I had envisioned for Yarr from the start. I didn't iterate on Yarr! so much as I just completely revamped the system. I was glad I had enough time to finish the parts I wanted to test.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
A pirate ship scavenges pieces and attaches them to itself to create a crazy configuration of weaponry, and uses them to fight rival ships in an endless idle game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.<br>
This was optional this week but I took inspiration from the Pirates theme from a couple of weeks ago.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
Mouse input, deterministic, real-time strategy, and the Constructor/Competitor/Collector play styles.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
The mechanic this prototype is evaluating is real-time difficulty scaling and construction in an idle wrapper.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
I want players to create crazy physics-defying structures and demolish enemy ships.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
The only controls the player has are mouse inputs. Along the top of the screen is the current treasure amount, as well as a list of things to buy. At the moment, only the first two items have any impact on gameplay, as they grant the players more rooms and more weapons, respectively.  Clicking and dragging on the icons begins the placement popup, which shows where items can be placed. Placing them successfully and with sufficient funds results in a purchase. Money is gained by destroying rooms on enemy ships, and each room of your own ship can only hold a maximum of three items (at this point, it is advisable to only use cannons).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
Buy more cannons as soon as you have the money. Fill up every room with 3 and your attack power will be extremely high.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
You are the captain of a fearsome pirate ship! However, your ship doesn't have much to it, and your funds are low. It might be a good idea to buy some weapons and use them to do some treasure-stealing! Wreck enemy ships for money and continue upgrading your ship!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
People who enjoy idle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br>
About 5 minutes.
</li>
